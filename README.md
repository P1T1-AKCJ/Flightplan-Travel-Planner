## Usage

Users will utilize the text input bar at the top of the page to type their desired tasks. Once satisfied the user will click on the "+" icon to the right of their text. This pushes the task to the "Not Yet Started" column on the webpage. Once this task has begun, the user may use the dropdown menu to change the status of the task to "Working On It". The dropdown menu is accessed by clicking on the "Status" button attatched to their task. This dropdown menu will also allow users to move their input to the "On Hold" or "Completed" columns, ultimately providing an organized, user-friendly to-do list for an upcoming trip.
